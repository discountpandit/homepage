              %span{:class => "quote-open"} 
              %p To connect businesses to people, producers to consumers and dreamers to their dreams… to revolutionize the way the world shops!

            %h2 Our Values
            %p We are passionate about the Business of Retail: We are ardent believers of the Retail Therapy and love the miracles it has done. We are proud to be associated with such a dynamic industry.
            %p We value our customers more than anything else: We take it as a matter of pride to serve our customers in the best possible way we can. Our happy customers are our biggest assets.
            %p We believe in continuous Research & Development:  We know that we are in a rapidly evolving industry. Our in-house research team continuously studies trends and patterns and works closely with our development team to ensure that our services get better every time.
            %h2 Our Team
            %p We call ourselves the “Mixed Bag”. We have been handpicked from diverse disciplines- geeks, techies, designers, shoppers, party hoppers, explorers … The only criterion that was kept in mind before choosing us was “You have to be the best in what you do”
            %p When our team members met for the first time for DiscountPandit, it was like ideas colliding head on. The chief reason why we were able to hold on to all those ideas was because we rocked as a team. We trusted and complimented each other well and yes in the end we came out with a service that is not only comprehensive in its approach but also revolutionary in its style…
